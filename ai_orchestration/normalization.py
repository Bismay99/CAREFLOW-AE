normalization.py

The missing layer between raw ASR/touch input and structured extraction
(PRD Section 6: "ASR output must be normalized before being mapped into
clinical fields — raw transcription is not treated as a structured fact").

Pipeline this module implements:
    ASR text -----------\
                          >--- combine (voice + touch confirmation/correction)
    Touch text ----------/
            |
            v
    language normalization (cleanup, script/spelling normalization)
            |
            v
    clinical term mapping (colloquial/regional phrasing -> clinical terms)
            |
            v
    normalized_text  --> handed to extraction.py for schema-driven field extraction

This is intentionally rule-based and inspectable (a lookup table), NOT an
LLM freely rewriting the patient's statement — the LLM is still only used
downstream, inside services/llm.py, for structured-field extraction over
this already-normalized text.
